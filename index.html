            <h1>MBTI  - Form M (Clone)</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Forget the online quizzes. This is a direct 1:1 of the official MBTI® Form M (aka the Step I) — the one that usually costs you $50 to take. I couldn't legally get their secret scoring data, so I did the next best thing: I rebuilt the scoring engine from the ground up using a massive psychometric study with over 11,000 participants to ensure it's just as accurate.</p>
            <p>Your answers to these questions will help show how you like to look at things and how you like to go about doing things. There are no "right" or "wrong" answers. Knowing your own preferences and learning about other people's can help you understand what your strengths are, what kinds of work you might enjoy and how people with different preferences can relate to one another and contribute to society.</p>
            <p>Please answer the questions based on how you usually feel or act.</p>
