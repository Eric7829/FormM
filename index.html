            <h1>MBTI  - Form M (Clone)</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">This is a full replication of the enterprise-grade 93-question MBTI® Form M (AKA Step I™), which usually costs around $50 CAD. Their scoring algorithm is proprietary, obviously, so I had to reverse-engineer it using published academic research which had a data set of 11,000+ people to make it psychometrically accurate.</p>
            <p>Your answers to these questions will help show how you like to look at things and how you like to go about doing things. There are no "right" or "wrong" answers. Knowing your own preferences and learning about other people's can help you understand what your strengths are, what kinds of work you might enjoy and how people with different preferences can relate to one another and contribute to society.</p>
            <p>Please answer the questions based on how you usually feel or act. Do not spend too much time thinking about each question, if you cannot decide on an answer, feel free to skip it.</p>
